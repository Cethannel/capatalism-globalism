          Extreme Poverty Rates Plummet Under Capitalism</a

          The standards of living even the poor have today would make even kings
          from a few hundred years ago jelous. Just the fact that we have
          running water and toilets would be miracle to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also have made many more advances past that such as all our modern
          technology.
        </li>
        <li>The GDP per person has also exploded since around the 1800s.</li>
        <li>
          It is also the lower classes that benefit the most from economic
          progress, such as when your average person could now afford a car
          thanks to Henry Ford and his production line.
        </li>
        <li>
          Poverty has also plummeted following the rise of capitalism. In 1820
          the percentage of the world living in extreme poverty (living on less
          than $1.90 a day) was at around 90% and it is now down bellow 10%.

          What Most Americans Don't Know about Extreme Poverty</a

      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          766,010,000, that is the number of people living in extreme poverty as
          of 2017. That is a large number, double the population of the USA.
        </li>
        <li>
          However 6,412,820,000 is another number, that is how many people
          /aren't/ living in extreme poverty.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            That number has roughly doubled since 1987, in just one generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            To be fare if your raise the threshold to 3.00$ a day that number
            looses about 1 billion people.
          </li>

              href="https://ourworldindata.org/no-matter-what-global-poverty-line"
              >However even if we look at up to people living on less than
              $10.00 a day the number has fallen and is continuing to do so.</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>To show a good example of this just look at China</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In 1981 over 88% of the population lived in extreme poverty which is
            around 878 million people which is more than the total number of
            people in the world living in extreme poverty in 2013.
          </li>
          <li>
            The rate rapidly fell to 61% in 1987, 41% in 1999, 15% in 2008, and
            just 1.85% in 2013
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no concrete data from prior to 1980, but it is estimated
            that it was around the same since the 19th century.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This rapid change was due to China leaving communism and moving
              towards more of a free market.
            </li>
            <li>
              This started in the 1970s, but only really got started in the 80s
              and 90s.

          In the past grinding poverty was the norm, but now it is the

        <li>
          As markets have become more free people have become more prosperous.

      <ul>
        <li>Under Capatalism resources are distrobuted much more equally.</li>
        <li>
          If you were to bring someone from the 1700s to today and show them a
          rich persons house they would be amazed, but not by things that they
          have that others don't, but by common things.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They would be astonished by machines that wash and dry clothes for
            you, or even the fact that people have many sets of clean cloths.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also something as simple as a fridge in the house would astonish
            them not to mention ovens and microwaves.
          </li>
          <li>
            As well as things like being able to go to the toilet without either
            going to an outhouse or having to deal with a chamber pot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being able to listen to any music or watch any movie ever made from
            the confort of your own home whenever you want.
          </li>
          <li>
            To something as simple as hot and cold running water that is so
            cheap it is basically free.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          These things used to only be available to kings and even then this
          would be luxury to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          These are massive improvements in human society that reduces the
          divide between the rich and the poor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The material differences of the poor and the rich have massively
          decreased under capatalism.

          Many inovations go unnoticed as they are small or not properly
          visible.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These are things like small parts being slightly changed on
            something like a shelf which doesn't change it too much, but results
            in a reduction of weight which makes it cost less.
          </li>
          <li>
            These changes take to time to be visible and reduce the price or
            increase the quality by a significant amount, but over a long enough
            timeline they will.
          </li>
          <li>This is also shown with Pizza.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pizza has changed much over the years from better methods of
              preparing it, to making it easier to freeze or transport.
            </li>
            <li>
              These changes are tiny, but add up the Pizza we eat now, which
              tastes better, is delivered faster and looks better.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            There are infinitly many variables and processes that go into making
            something as simple as a pencil. All these can be slightly tweaked
            and changed to make it better and cheaper.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Countries that have moved away from capitalism have increased their
          number of poor and lowered the standard of living of their citizens.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is shown in Venezuela where it used to be one of the richest
            countries is South America and is now one of the poorest.

          <li>
            After they voted in a socialist leader and he closed down and made
            public most of the economy life went down hill.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is now easier to buy essential supplies like toilet paper and
            food in prisons than in normal stores.
